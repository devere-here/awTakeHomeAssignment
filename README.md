# Five City Weather App

This weather app tells you the weather, temperature, humidity, pressure, and wind speed of five coastal cities in America. 

The buttons for each city as well as the weather info page are styled to look like small islands in the ocean. When a user hovers over a specific island an image of the corresponding city appears in the upper section of the screen.

The app uses React, React-Redux, CSS Modules, and the Open Weather Map API.

This map uses a boilerplate designed for a full-stack application, but functionally this is purely a front-end app.
